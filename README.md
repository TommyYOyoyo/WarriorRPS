# WarriorRPS
Yet another school project.

A classic-or not so classic rock paper scissors game.
But- with combats!

How to play?
- Download this repo on your local machine
- Host a localhost (anything similar to liveserver) with those files
- Enjoy! Win Rock Paper Scissors against the computer to attack the enemy. Kill them before they slaughter you!
